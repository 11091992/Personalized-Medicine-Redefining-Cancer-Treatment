# Personalized-Medicine-Redefining-Cancer-Treatment
During the past several years it has been found that how precision medicine and, more concretely,
how genetic testing is going to disrupt the way diseases like cancer are treated. But this is only
partially happening due to the huge amount of manual work still required. Once sequenced, a
cancer tumor can have thousands of genetic mutations. But the challenge is distinguishing the
mutations that contribute to tumor growth (drivers) from the neutral mutations (passengers).
Currently this interpretation of genetic mutations is being done manually. This is a very timeconsuming
task where a clinical pathologist has to manually review and classify every single
genetic mutation based on evidence from text-based clinical literature.
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) has made available an expert-annotated
knowledge base where world-class researchers and oncologists have manually annotated
thousands of mutations. We need to develop a Machine Learning algorithm that, using this
knowledge base as a baseline, automatically classifies genetic variations based on clinical
evidence (text).
